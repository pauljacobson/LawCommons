Law Commons is anÂ initiative focused on highlighting projects that contribute towards open law resources and building the Law Commons overall.

My name is <a href="http://pauljacobson.co/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Jacobson</a>. I am excited about initiatives that contribute to what I think of as the broader Law Commons - a collection of freely available and high quality legal information resources for the general public.
